# Credit Eligibility Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the process of predicting whether a bank client is eligible for credit approval. We use a Logistic Regression model to handle binary outcomes such as "approved" or "not approved".

## Methods
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data.
- **Variable selection**: Identifying the most important features to use in the model.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied to predict the binary outcome (credit approval: yes or no).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC score to evaluate the model.

## Results
- Final results will be updated here after running the model.
